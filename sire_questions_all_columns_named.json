These should include the method chosen to\nensure availability of GMDSS equipment at sea.\nDetails of equipment fitted can be found in the Record of Approved GMDSS Radio Installation.\nSOLAS defines three methods to ensure availability of GMDSS equipment at sea.\n• At sea electronic maintenance, requiring the carriage of a qualified radio/electronic officer and adequate\nspares and manuals.\n• Duplication of certain equipment\n• Shore based maintenance\nShips engaged on voyages in sea areas A1 and A2 are required to use at least one of the three maintenance\nmethods outlined above, or a combination as may be approved by their administration. Ships engaged on voyages in\nsea areas A3 and A4 are required to use at least two of the methods outlined above.\nIn most cases, A3 ships carry duplicate equipment and use shore-based maintenance, A1 and A2 ships use shorebased\nmaintenance only. The choice of using shore-based maintenance does not infer there should necessarily be a\ncontract and/or agreement, but that maintenance should be carried out annually by a shore-based 'expert'\norganisation.\nGMDSS equipment is required to be powered from three sources of supply:\n• The ship's normal supply.\n• The ship's emergency generator (if fitted)\n• A dedicated radio battery supply.\nThe batteries must be charged by an automatic charger that is powered by the main and emergency generators.\nThe batteries are required to have the capacity to power the equipment for 1 hour on ships with an emergency\ngenerator, and 6 hours on ships not fitted with an emergency generator.\nThe capacity of the battery or batteries should be checked, using an appropriate method, annually. One method of\nchecking the capacity of an accumulator battery is to fully discharge and recharge the battery, using normal operating\ncurrent and period (e.g. 10 hours), when the ship is not at sea.

    "Inspection Guidance": "The details of each marine diesel engine installed on board to which MARPOL Annex VI regulation 13 applies can be\nfound in paragraph 2.2.1 of the vessel’s International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) Certificate.\nThe level of NOx emissions for each engine is described by Tier designation. Tier I and Tier II status is usually\nachieved via engine design. Tier III status is achieved by the use of additional equipment such as Selective Catalytic\nReduction (SCR) or Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. Such equipment is not run continuously and must be\noperating to achieve Tier III status. Thus engines may be run at Tier II or Tier III depending upon local requirements.\nEngines must be operating in Tier III mode in a NOx Emission Control Area that applies to the vessel.\nNOx Emission Control Areas apply as follows:\n• Baltic Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2021.\n• North Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2021.\n• North American for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2016.\n• United States Caribbean Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2016.\nMARPOL Annex VI and the NOx Technical Code require Technical Files for each of these diesel engines to be\nmaintained on board, together with the following records in relation to NOx emissions:\n• A Record Book of Engine Parameters for those engines required to undergo Engine Parameter Checks at\ninitial and subsequent surveys.\n• A record that shows only engines operating at Tier III are in use in a NOx Tier III emission control area\n(NECA)\n• Ships fitted with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) are required to record the discharge of solid residues and\nbleed-off water in an EGR Record Book.\nWhere diesel engines are fitted with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System there should be a strategy for\nmonitoring the catalyst condition/degradation set out in the engine’s technical file. This may involve continuous\nmonitoring of NOx levels or a prediction of the life of the catalyst under operating conditions together with annual spot\nchecks of NOx levels. Vessel staff should be familiar with the strategy, its implementation and associated equipment.\nRecords should be available on board of measured NOx levels.\nThe vessel operator should have developed procedures for maintaining these Records Books, either in paper or\nelectronic format, in accordance with MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 13, the NOx Technical Code and any Flag\nAdministration guidance. The procedure should include:\n• The information required to be entered in the Record Books.\n• Who is required to enter the details in the Record Books.\n• When entries are required to be made in the Record Books.\n• Guidance on any additional record keeping requirements of local or national legislation such as the U.S.\nVessel General Permit (VGP).\n• When the Master is required to verify the accuracy of the Record Book entries and sign each page.\n• The procedure for correcting entries made in error.\n• The procedure for entering operations or emissions which had been overlooked and not entered in a Record\nBook in the correct chronological order.\n• Instructions for retention of completed Record Books.\n• The actions to take if any NOx abatement system fitted suffers a failure that cannot be rectified within one\nhour.\nWhere the vessel is using an electronic record book for recording the entries required in the Record Books,\ninstructions for the use of the electronic record book should be provided, including automatic backing up of data to\noffline storage and an appropriate method of data recovery if the system were to fail or not be available from the\nship’s network. . The use of the electronic record book should be authorised by a Declaration from flag/class.\nThe Record Books may form part of an existing logbook or electronic record book.",

    "Inspection Guidance": "The vessel operator should have developed procedures which provided guidance for managing cargo and vapour\nconnections at the cargo manifolds to prevent and detect leakages. These procedures should include:\n• Manifold connection via hose or marine loading arm.\n• The fitting and monitoring of pressure gauges at each manifold connection outboard of the manifold valve.\n• The fitting of blanks to all unused manifold connections.\n• The fitting of blanks or caps to all drains and sample points, except while in use.\n• The use of fixed and portable drip-trays and the management of drained or spilled cargo.\n• The management of vapour manifolds and connections.\n• Safe work on elevated manifold platforms, if fitted.\n• The supporting of cargo hoses during cargo transfer.\n• Restrictions on the use of the mid-ships hose-handling crane(s) during cargo operations.\n• The management of bow and stern manifolds, if fitted.\nManifold drip trays should be clean and free from cargo residues.\nSuitable means of draining the drip trays to a cargo tank or drain tank should be provided. On chemical tankers, driptrays\nshould be drained to appropriate tanks with due regard to toxicity and compatibility requirements.\nManifold drip-tray drains to deck should be fitted with valves and either capped or plugged.\nPressure gauge stems should be fitted with valves and capped whenever gauges are not fitted.\nIt is generally accepted that steel blanks should be of the same thickness as the flanges to which they are attached,\nbut this will not necessarily result in the pressure capability being the same as that of the associated pipework. It is\nthe pressure rating of the blank which is important, and blanks made of materials such as titanium have a superior\nstrength and may therefore be significantly thinner for the same pressure rating as a mild steel blank. If such blanks\nare fitted, documentation should be on board to prove that the pressure rating is adequate for the service.\n",

    "Inspection Guidance": "The vessel operator should have developed procedures for managing cargo and vapour connections at the cargo\nmanifolds. These procedures should include:\n• Manifold connection via hose or marine loading arm.\n• In LNG vessels, procedures for disconnection, including:\no Lining up to drain the system from the MLA, and/or manifold, to shore or ship tank.\no Isolation of liquid and vapour valves on either side of the manifold connection.\no Removal of liquid from the MLA, and/or manifolds, to shore or ship tank.\no Purging of flammable vapours from the connection.\no Verification that the target conditions (flammable gas concentration) have been achieved, using a\nmeter calibrated for measuring methane in nitrogen.\no Disconnection of the manifold.\n• The fitting and monitoring of pressure gauges at each manifold connection outboard of the manifold valve.\n• The fitting of blanks to all unused manifold connections.\n• The fitting of blanks or caps to all vents, drains and sample points, except while in use.\n• The use of fixed and portable drip-trays and the management of drained or spilled cargo.\n• The management of vapour manifolds and connections.\n• Safe work on elevated manifold platforms, if fitted.\n• The supporting of cargo hoses during cargo transfer.\n• Restrictions on the use of the mid-ships hose-handling crane(s) during cargo operations.\n• The management of bow and stern manifolds, if fitted.\n• The hazards associated with low temperature cargoes.\n• The use of manifold strainers\n\nThe offshore manifolds on LNG carriers are often pressurised with nitrogen and it is normal that the space between\nthe manifold valve and the flange is under pressure. This does not indicate valve leakage. Valve leakage would be\nindicated by frosting.\n\nGratings on LNG tanker manifold drip trays are sometimes made of two different materials; gratings near to the\nconnections may be of stainless steel, and the gratings on the periphery made of composite material. The stainlesssteel\ngratings are designed to bear the point load of the cargo arm supports in the event of a PERC’s release. If,\nhowever, the loading arm supports are located on the composite section, the vessel should confirm that they are\nconstructed of sufficient strength to take the point load.\n\nManifold drip trays for LNG transfers should be kept as dry as reasonably practical. Water should not be introduced\ndeliberately, or rain-water allowed to accumulate. This will prevent rapid phase transition in the event of a spill.\n\nManifold drip-tray drains to deck should be fitted with valves and either capped or plugged.\n\nPressure gauge stems should be fitted with valves and capped whenever gauges are not fitted.\n\nIt is generally accepted that steel blanks should be of the same thickness as the flanges to which they are attached,\nbut this will not necessarily result in the pressure capability being the same as that of the associated pipework. It is\nthe pressure rating of the blank which is important, and blanks made of materials such as titanium have a superior\nstrength and may therefore be significantly thinner for the same pressure rating as a mild steel blank. If such blanks\nare fitted, documentation should be on board to prove that the pressure rating is adequate for the service.\n\nManifold strainers may be fitted at the option of the terminal or the vessel. The provision of the strainers may be by\nthe terminal or by the vessel. Where fitted they must be in good order and frequently checked and cleaned as\nrequired. Many strainers are designed for one-way flow only. They should not be by-passed.\n\nManifold valves and lines should be clearly marked as to whether they are liquid or vapour.\n\nNon-essential personnel should be kept clear of the manifold area during cargo operations and access should be\nvisibly restricted.",
    "Suggested Inspector Actions": "• Sight, and where necessary review, the company procedures for managing cargo and vapour connections at\nthe cargo manifolds.\n• Inspect cargo and vapour manifolds, including bow and stern manifolds where fitted, and verify that the\narrangements were in alignment with industry best practice and, where applicable, regulation.\n• Interview a deck rating on manifold watch to verify their familiarity with:\no The hazards associated with low temperature cargoes.\no The identification of potential manifold leakage.",

    "Inspection Guidance": "Insulating matting is only required at the front and rear of switchboards.\nIndividual machinery starter boxes throughout the machinery space are not considered switchboards and do not\nrequire insulating matting in front or behind them.\nSome decks are made from composite insulating material and will not need extra insulation. Where this is the case\nand insulation matting is not provided, ship’s drawings should be available to demonstrate the extent and safe\nworking voltage of the composite deck covering installed.\nInsulation matting should be suitable for the specific switchboard voltage but should be rated not less than IEC\n61111:2009 Class O or equivalent which has a safe working voltage of up to 1000 volts. Switchboards with voltages\nhigher than 1000 volts should be protected with matting of a higher rating as appropriate, for example Class 1 with a\nsafe working voltage up to 7500 volts.",
    "Suggested Inspector Actions": "• During the course of the inspection of the machinery spaces, verify that:\no Switchboards were provided with the required deck insulation of an appropriate safe working\nvoltage.\no Insulating matting or composite deck material was complete and undamaged.",
    "Expected Evidence": "• Certification, marking or other documentary evidence of the safe working voltage rating for the deck\ninsulation in use.",
